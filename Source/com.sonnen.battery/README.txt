Adds support for Sonnen Batterie - Time of Use(ToU)

The sonnenBatterie does not only store energy, it's smart. As an intelligent, backup capable, energy storage system, sonnenBatterie 10 can integrate into any existing PV system on the market. Gain your energy independence now and secure yourself against future energy price increases.

This app allows you to set or reset Time-Of-Use.
This is very handy with changing energy prices, you can pause your batterie delivery on low tariff or charge batterie on low tariff - so being fully charged in times with high tariff.

Reset Time-Of-Use is very handy, because once schedule is set - the schedule is repeated daily. Reset will clear the schedule. Please use this before setting a new schedule. 

Be aware, atm. only one schedule/Time-Of-Use is supported - and not multiple like example: 10-14:charge:2000 AND 17-23:charge:2000

Usage notes:

Be sure to create at least a "sonnenBatterie" home battery device. 
This device is mandatory to provide data to all other derived devices such as "household", "grid" and "solar panel".
The derived devices offer nicely grouped capabilities, convenient insights and dedicated status indicators.  
Also you can associate your solar panel with your home's roof zone, your grid device and home battery with cellar or whatever zone fits.

Instead of using this app's derived devices also dedicated apps providing smart meter or solar panel/inverter devices can be used.
However when having multiple devices providing the same type of data, be sure to exclude all but one from Energy tab by using the device's "Exclude from Energy" setting.
Also consider excluding the household device from Energy.
