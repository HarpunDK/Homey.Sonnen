Adds support for Sonnen Batterie - Time of Use(ToU)

The sonnenBatterie does not only store energy, it's smart. As an intelligent, backup capable, energy storage system, sonnenBatterie 10 can integrate into any existing PV system on the market. Gain your energy independence now and secure yourself against future energy price increases.

This app allows you to set or reset Time-Of-Use.
This is very handy with changing energy prices, you can pause your batterie delivery on low tariff or charge batterie on low tariff - so being fully charged in times with high tariff.

Reset Time-Of-Use is very handy, because once schedule is set - the schedule is repeated daily. Reset will clear the schedule. Please use this before setting a new schedule. 

Be aware, atm. only one schedule/Time-Of-Use is supported - and not multiple like example: 10-14:charge:2000 AND 17-23:charge:2000


Please visit the settings page, after installing this application. Configuration-fields are mandatory.
